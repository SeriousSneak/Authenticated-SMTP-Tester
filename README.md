# Authenticated-SMTP-Tester

SMTP authentication is typically used with devices like printers to send mail to Office 365. Office 365 required authenticated SMTP to get sent over TLS which makes using tools like Telnet to test very difficult. Authenticated SMTP Tester allows you to send mail to Office 365 (or out through Office 365) using Authenticated SMTP.
