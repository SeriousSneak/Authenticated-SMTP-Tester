# Authenticated-SMTP-Tester

This program is used to test Authenticated SMTP. Office 365 offers Authenticated SMTP, but
TLS is required. This app allows toggling of TLS on or off to test Authenticated SMTP. The app \
launches by default with Office 365 settings (ie. The endpoint is set to smtp.office365.com), although 
any end point can be entered.
